Framework
=========

A framework to quick start web development. Based on Codeigniter, HTML5BP, and other open source libraries.

## Why did we build this framework?

We wanted a production-ready framework that uses the latest and greatest technologies in web development.

This framework should eliminate choice paralysis by choosing a few, well-tested existing frameworks.

This framework should promote proper HTML5 syntax, free of browser-specific conventions.

This framework should not be bloated, it should not significantly impact page load time.

This framework should be avilable as a backend package in PHP and simply as a frontend package.
